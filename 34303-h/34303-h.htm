<h2>A New Bat (Genus Myotis) From Mexico<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></h2>

<h4>By</h4>

<h3>WALTER W. DALQUEST AND E. RAYMOND HALL</h3>


<p>While one of us (Dalquest) was in a dugout canoe that was being
paddled up a small unnamed tributary of the Rio Coatzacoalcos,
through dense jungle, he grasped a decayed and termite damaged
tree-trunk projecting approximately three feet above the surface of
the water to steady the canoe. At that instant two bats were detected
in one of the many small holes in the trunk, which was eight
to nine inches in diameter. It was a simple matter to enlarge the
hole and extract the animals. Superficially they resembled silvery-haired
bats (<i>Lasionycteris</i>) but their naked interfemoral membranes
and other features suggested that they belonged to the genus <i>Myotis</i>.
Subsequently, study in the laboratory showed this to be the fact and
revealed also that they are of an heretofore unnamed species which
may be known as:</p>


<p class="center"><b>Myotis argentatus</b>, new species</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Type.</i>&mdash;Male, adult, skin with skull, No. 19228, Mus. Nat. Hist., Univ. Kansas;
14 kilometers southwest of Coatzocoalcos, 100 feet elevation, Veracruz,
Mexico; 2 February 1947; obtained by Walter W. Dalquest; original No. 7052.</p>

<p><i>Range.</i>&mdash;Known only from the type locality.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i>&mdash;Size medium for the genus (see measurements), tail short; foot
long; ears and membranes black; pelage long (maximum length on middle of
back 9 mm.) and black; upper parts with overhairs tipped with whitish especially
on rump; underparts from posterior part of thorax posteriorly with
all of the hairs tipped with this same whitish color; skull with preorbital part
small in relation to brain case; teeth small in relation to total area of palate;
brain case much inflated; ventral margin of foramen magnum evenly rounded.</p>

<p><i>Comparison.</i>&mdash;From <i>Myotis albescens</i> (E. Geffroy) known to us by specimens
in the United States National Museum from Paraguay (Tacural), Panama
(Tabernilla), and Nicaragua (Prinzapolca R. and Escondido R.), <i>argentatus</i>
differs in: Body and foot longer; tail relatively shorter (57 and 58% of
length of head and body versus 76 (62-83)% in <i>albescens</i>); tibia shorter;
pelage longer, and black instead of brown; silver tipping of fur on hinder
back markedly more conspicuous; precranial part of skull, when viewed from
above, larger in relation to brain case; postorbital constriction less abrupt,
that is to say, skull "longer-waisted"; occlusal surfaces of teeth of equal area
and therefore occupying a relatively smaller percentage of total area of palatal
surface; ventral margin of foramen magnum less deeply indented; ventrally
prominent part of basioccipital twice as wide.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>(240)</span></p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The relatively slight wear on the teeth of the female
of <i>M. argentatus</i> and the large ends on the bones of the wings indicate
that it is immature. Its measurements, recorded below, average
smaller than those of the adult holotype, a male, and the silvery
tipping on the upper parts is almost lacking from the pelage which
is shorter than in the holotype.</p>

<p>Among at least American kinds of <i>Myotis</i>, <i>argentatus</i> is extreme
in small area of occlusal surface of the upper molariform teeth in
relation to the total area of the palatal surface of the skull. <i>M. albescens</i>
previously was regarded as extreme in this feature. The
distance across the third upper molars, from the outside of one tooth
<span class='pagenum'>(241)</span>
to the outside of the other, is 5.5 mm. in the holotype of <i>argentatus</i>
and 5.4 mm. in a specimen of corresponding age and sex of <i>albescens</i>.
The distance between the third upper molars, from the lingual side
of one tooth to the lingual side of the other, is 2.9 mm. in <i>argentatus</i>
and 2.8 mm. in <i>albescens</i>.</p>

<p>In each of our two specimens there is no sagittal crest but instead
a low ridge one millimeter wide which marks the space between the
margins of the two temporal muscles.</p>

<p>Allusion already has been made to the resemblance of the newly
named <i>Myotis argentatus</i> to the silvery-haired bat, <i>Lasionycteris
noctivagans</i> (LeConte). The whitish tips of the hairs are slightly
more yellowish in <i>argentatus</i> but the difference is so slight as to be
detected by only the most careful comparison. The remainder of
the pelage in <i>argentatus</i> is black as in the darkest individuals of
<i>Lasionycteris</i>.</p>

<p>Among named kinds of the genus <i>Myotis</i>, the species <i>argentatus</i>
most closely resembles <i>Myotis albescens</i> which, up to now has been
recorded from as far south as Argentina, in South America, and as
far north as Nicaragua, in Central America (Miller and Allen, Bull.
U. S. Nat. Mus., 144:202, 203, 1928). The differences detected between
the two species are indicated above in the paragraph of comparisons
and some other differences can be detected by comparing
measurements given below with those of <i>M. albescens</i> as recorded
by Miller and Allen (<i>op. cit.</i>: 204-205). In initial comparisons with
<i>albescens</i>, only Paraguayan specimens were employed. It was felt
that specimens of <i>albescens</i> from the northernmost localities of occurrence
might more closely resemble <i>argentatus</i>. Accordingly, we
appealed a second time to Dr. A. R. Kellogg for comparative material
and he lent us the specimens (alcoholics with skulls separate)
in the U. S. National Museum from Central America. These also
differ from our newly named bat in the same fashion as do the
South American specimens. Further, the number and magnitude of
the differences between <i>albescens</i> and <i>argentatus</i> greatly exceed any
that can be pointed to between the American subspecies of any other
one full species of the genus <i>Myotis</i>. Full specific, rather than mere
subspecific, status, therefore, is suggested for the bat here named
<i>Myotis argentatus</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Measurements.</i>&mdash;The adult, male type, and the immature female specimen
